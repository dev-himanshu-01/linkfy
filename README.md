## 🧠 Lessons Learned

The project was built over the course of 10 consecutive days, as part of a #10DayWebBuild challenge on Twitter.

- One of the crucial things I learned is that before building a product, one should allocate enough time for brainstorming and achieve a certain level of clarity regarding the design, color palette, features, and implementation. This preparation makes everything easier.

- Instead of watching tutorials over and over again on a particular technology, I find it easier to learn and understand from its documentation. It's simple and pretty straightforward.

- First, focus on making it work! Start by building the core engine, and then proceed to work on the frontend. The frontend itself is not the problem; the challenge lies in making all the components—APIs, backend, and database—work together seamlessly.

- There will be lows and highs, days when you'll be building like a madman, and days when you'll be making small changes here and there. Embrace it! Building a product should be fun, and ups and downs are part of the process.

- In the end, no matter how much brainstorming or planning you do, there will always be unforeseen changes and difficulties that you can't predict. And that's part of the fun!

Happy Coding :)
